                -> Before annotation based configuration, we were using XML based config
                   which wsd lengthy and hard to maintain.
                -> Now Instead of XML files, we can configure Spring beans using annotations.
                   This is called annotation-based configuration.
                -> Some common annotations are @Bean, @Component, @ComponentScan etc
